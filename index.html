                    N.W.A. in full means <strong>Niggaz Wit Attitudes</strong>, an american Hiphop <em>gangstar-rap group </em>from Compton,Los Angelles. It was formed in 1987 by its five members; Dr. Dre, Eazy E, Ice Cube ,Dj Yella and MC Ren. The co-founder was the late Eazy E who was a highschool-dropout and a alleged drug dealer.From the money he got from selling drugs, he made a record label known as <em >Ruthless Records.</em> together with Jerry Heller, who later came to backstab them.
                    Its members were among the earliest and most significant popularizers and controversial figures of the gangstar rap . They were also considered one of the most influential groups in the history of Hiphop Music.
                    I really like N.W.A. because of they helped redifine the genre, by influencing Black raps that were intelligent, socially and political aware. They also protesed against evils of the society such as racism, gang-violence and corruption,especially among the governament.</P>
